# **Text Summarization App**

A simple yet powerful web application that allows users to input text or dialogues and get a concise summary instantly. Built with a **Python backend** powered by a **summarization model**, and a **frontend** designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This app provides an easy-to-use interface with real-time results for text summarization.

---

## **Features**

* **Text Summarization**: Users can input any text or dialogue, and the app will generate a summary.
* **Real-time Summarization**: Immediate response with the summary after text submission.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views with a simple, clean UI.
* **Lightweight**: The app is designed to work efficiently and is easy to deploy.

---

## **Technologies Used**

* **Frontend**:

  * HTML
  * CSS (for styling)
  * JavaScript (for handling user interactions)
* **Backend**:

  * Python (for running the summarization model)
  * Flask (for backend services)
* **Model**:

  * Summarization model built with a deep learning framework (e.g., Hugging Face, GPT-based models)

## **Installation Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: Required to run the backend.
2. **Node.js** (optional, if you’re planning to enhance the frontend with Node.js-based features).

### **Clone the Repository**

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarization-app.git
```

### **Backend Setup**

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd text-summarization-app
   ```

2. Set up a **Python virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Model Setup**:

   * Ensure that the summarization model is available and accessible for your backend. You may need to download a pre-trained model, for instance, from **Hugging Face** if using a transformer-based model.

5. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py  # or your entry file for Flask
   ```

6. The backend server will now be running on `http://localhost:5000/` (or another port if specified).

### **Frontend Setup**

1. If you are enhancing the frontend or want to run the app independently:

   * Open the `index.html` file in your browser directly, or
   * Set up a local server (for example, using **VS Code Live Server** or a similar extension).

2. The front end will now be live and accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or `file://index.html` if opened locally.

## **How to Use**

1. Open the **Text Summarization App** in your browser.
2. **Input the dialogue or text** that you want to summarize in the provided text area.
3. Press the **"Summarize"** button to generate the summary.
4. The summary will appear instantly below the input box in the "Summary" section.
5. If needed, you can enter new text and summarize again.
